# Tickets Frontend

This is the frontend project for ticket visualization

It provides a summary about open/close tickets, number of tickets by technology, average number of days to close a ticket,
and average customer satisfaction.

Important points:

1. Use of CryptoJs for password encryption
2. Protection of routes with user context
3. Use of fusion charts
4. Use of MUI for tables with pagination
5. Different visualizations for Admin and Non-admin users
